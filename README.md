Lumina is a WYSIWYG desktop editor for Markdown and plain text files. You write formatted text — Lumina handles the Markdown syntax behind the scenes. Open any `.md` or `.txt` file and it just works. No vault setup, no plugins, no configuration.

*The best tool is the one you forget you're using.*

## Download

### Fork development

This fork adds local file links and Chinese punctuation support in bold Markdown, a **Current folder** list above Recent, a remembered **Open File** directory, and document tabs with independent editing history and automatic saving.

The `refactor/tauri` branch uses Tauri for desktop development and builds. Windows requires Rust 1.88+, the MSVC C++ build tools, and WebView2 alongside Node.js/npm.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev          # Tauri desktop with Vite HMR
npm run build        # Tauri executable, without an installer
npm run legacy:dev   # Electron regression comparison
npm run legacy:build # Electron compilation into out/
```

`npm run tauri:bundle` creates the configured Tauri installer. Electron packaging and release commands are explicitly prefixed with `legacy:`: `legacy:build:win`, `legacy:build:mac`, and `legacy:publish:win` / `legacy:publish:mac`.

The Windows executable is `src-tauri/target/release/lumina-desktop.exe`; renderer assets are in `dist/tauri/`. The launcher defaults Cargo downloads to this checkout's `.cache/cargo` (on D: for the current checkout) and honors an existing `CARGO_HOME`. This is a process-local setting; the global Rust configuration stays intact. Tauri stores its own settings under the `com.zaxioon.lumina` application-data directory, separately from the existing Electron installation.

Word export runs in the browser and writes a `.docx` through the native save dialog. PDF export opens the system print dialog: select **Save as PDF** or **Microsoft Print to PDF** there. Native right-click spelling suggestions are currently unavailable in the Tauri host.

Word export embeds accessible local and inline images. Remote images blocked by the host's network policy or the server's cross-origin policy become labeled placeholders, with an export warning.

Android/iOS support is a host skeleton. Mobile file authorization, layout, soft-keyboard behavior, and printing need separate implementation and device validation; desktop acceptance covers the desktop host.

Verified in the Windows Tauri application: Chinese bold text, local document links, local images, saving edits to disk, Word export with text/tables/images, and PDF output through Microsoft Print to PDF. Mobile behavior remains unverified.

The download links below point to upstream Lumina releases. Those installers contain the upstream feature set; use this source checkout to try the additions listed above.

| Platform | Installer | Requires |
|---|---|---|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | [Lumina-1.6.9-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/micahman33/lumina/releases/download/v1.6.9/Lumina-1.6.9-arm64.dmg) | macOS 13+ · M1/M2/M3/M4 |
| Windows (x64) | [Lumina Setup 1.6.9.exe](https://github.com/micahman33/lumina/releases/download/v1.6.9/Lumina.Setup.1.6.9.exe) | Windows 10/11 |

**macOS:** Download the `.dmg`, drag Lumina to `/Applications`. On first launch, if macOS shows an "unverified developer" warning, right-click the app and choose **Open**.

**Windows:** Run the installer — Lumina is added to your Start Menu and Desktop automatically.

## Features

### Writing experience

- **WYSIWYG editing** — formatted text as you type; no raw Markdown syntax in your way
- **Auto Markdown shortcuts** — type `# ` for Heading 1, `**` for bold, `- ` for a bullet list, `> ` for a blockquote, ` ``` ` for a code block, and more
- **Floating toolbar** — select any text for an instant formatting bar right above your selection
- **Focus Mode** (`⌘⇧↩` / `Ctrl+Shift+Enter`) — collapses the sidebar and toolbar, narrows the canvas to 65 characters

### Formatting

| Element | Shortcut | Toolbar |
|---|---|---|
| Bold | `⌘B` / `Ctrl+B` | ✓ |
| Italic | `⌘I` / `Ctrl+I` | ✓ |
| Strikethrough | — | ✓ |
| Inline Code | — | ✓ |
| Link | `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` | ✓ |
| Heading 1–4 | `#` + Space | ✓ Dropdown |
| Bullet List | `- ` + Space | ✓ |
| Numbered List | `1.` + Space | ✓ |
| Task List | `- [ ]` + Space | ✓ |
| Blockquote | `> ` + Space | ✓ |
| Code Block | ` ``` ` + Enter | ✓ |

### Images

- **Drag and drop** — drag any image from Finder or Explorer directly into the editor
- **Clipboard paste** — paste an image from your clipboard (`⌘V` / `Ctrl+V`) and it's inserted inline
- **Auto-organized** — images are copied into an `images/` subfolder next to your document and referenced with relative paths, so the folder stays self-contained and moveable
- **Toolbar insert** — pick a file via the system dialog using the image button in the toolbar
- **Resize** — click any image to select it, then drag the corner handle to resize; the width is saved with the file

### Tables

- **Table Wizard** — hover over a grid in the toolbar to choose any size, click to insert
- **Resizable columns** — drag column borders to adjust width
- **Right-click actions** — add or remove rows and columns from a context menu

### Links

- **Insert / edit** — `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` with text selected, or use the toolbar
- **Open in browser** — click any link in the editor to open it externally
- **Anchor links** — `#heading` links scroll to the correct section within the document

### File management

- **Open** — `⌘O` / `Ctrl+O`, File menu, drag a `.md` file onto the window, or double-click from Finder/Explorer
- **Save / Save As** — `⌘S` and `⌘⇧S` / `Ctrl+S` and `Ctrl+Shift+S`
- **Auto-save** — changes are saved 2 seconds after you stop typing
- **Unsaved draft** — switching away from an unsaved new file preserves it as a scratchpad in the sidebar; click "Unsaved draft" to return to it
- **Recent files sidebar** — quick-access panel with search, pinning, rename, and Reveal in Finder/Explorer
- **Unsaved changes guard** — closing with unsaved work prompts Save / Don't Save / Cancel

### Export

- **PDF** — print-quality via Electron's print engine
- **HTML** — self-contained styled document, ready to share
- **Word (.docx)** — compatible with Microsoft Word and Google Docs

All exports available from the toolbar **Export** button or the Command Palette.

### Productivity

- **Command Palette** (`⌘⇧P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`) — fuzzy-search every editor action and recent file from one panel
- **Find & Replace** (`⌘F` / `Ctrl+F`) — match counter, step-through navigation, replace one or all
- **Outline Panel** (`⌘⇧O` / `Ctrl+Shift+O`) — live heading tree; click any entry to scroll to it
- **Code blocks** — syntax highlighting for 25 languages with a language picker pill on each block
- **Mermaid diagrams** — fenced `mermaid` code blocks render as flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and more, with a toggle to view or edit the source

### Appearance

- **Light, Dark, and System** themes — follows your OS automatically, or set a manual preference
- **Plain text mode** — open `.txt` files without Markdown formatting; toolbar adjusts automatically
